# Introduction  
This project was meant to be a (As the name suggests) a file uploader tool, which means users would be able to upload data files (Json, xml, csv,...) to insert the records onto the database. 

Unfortunately, I got busy and was unable and unwilling to continue the project. But I think it's a good startup project all the same, so I decided to share it. 

I hope it helps someone, even though it's a bit old =P
